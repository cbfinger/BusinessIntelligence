This was my first ever attempt at anything React Native. I enjoyed the framework and found it rather easy to gets started an move quickly when putting together a quick UI. I found the more challenging part to be the using the 'Charts' framework in a Native Module. I choose to do in iOS and Swift to challenge myself as I havent written a lot of Swift code and I am more familiar with Kotlin. Thank you for this opportunity and I am excited for potential next steps.

The following modules are required to run my project

"moment": "^2.29.1",
"react-native-elements": "^3.4.2",
"react-native-vector-icons": "^8.1.0",
"react-number-format": "^4.7.3"

You will need to do a pod install as I installed the Charts library via Cocapods
